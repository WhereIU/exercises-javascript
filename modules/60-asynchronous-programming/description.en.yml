name: Asynchronous programming
description: |
  There are often situations in programming where the execution of an instruction needs to be delayed or delegated to another part of the code.
  Instead of waiting for a task to complete, the program can continue performing other operations while monitoring the status of the asynchronous task separately.

  Asyncronism allows for efficient execution time management, especially when dealing with latency, network requests, and I/O operations.
